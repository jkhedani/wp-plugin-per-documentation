A WordPress Plugin aimed at making documentation on your
site easier!

### Getting Started
Coming soon!


### Developer's Notes
Yay for you! We've setup Grunt to help you get to production faster without any
hassle at all. The way your grunt is currently helping:

  1. Compiling all your less on save using Watch.
  2. Minifying all your css and js.
  3. Concatenating all your css and js.

**Setting up your dev environment**

    $ npm install
    $ grunt

**Prepping the environment for production**

    $ grunt uglify

**Breaking down the environment**

End the node environment in terminal. That's it!
